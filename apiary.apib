# ClaraStream Services
ClaraStream Web Service API is a *product information management* service.

# Authentication
The ClaraStream API uses basic authentication. Currently each and every request requires authentication
in the header of the request. 
There is no session based authentication until we make the switch to OAuth in upcoming releases. 

# Getting Started

## SDK and Sample Code

Contact the ClaraStream team - support@clarastream.com - for more sample code and our PHP Software Development Kit for the API. 

## Creating an endpoint

A good place to start is to make a "listener endpoint" for your application. This will receive operation requests from ClaraStream, such as starting a sync.
Without creating this endpoint ClaraStream will have limited functionality in the user interface.

The basic idea of syncing products to your website, is that a user signals ClaraStream to sync a specific data set. 
ClaraStream then sends a request to your endpoint, and your remote endpoint then makes a request back to ClaraStream to pull down the data that was asked for. 
Generally its much quicker to pull information to you. 

Here is a sample endpoint using Node and Express: 

```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var http= require('http');

app.use(express.bodyParser()); 

// public endpoint to listen for ClaraStream sync request
app.post('/sync', function(req, res) {
    // Information ClaraStream will pass you as part of the POST request
    var timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    var userId = "" + req.body.userId;
    var projectId = "" + req.body.projectId;
    var imageBaseURL = "" + req.body.imageBaseURL;
    var syncImages = "" + req.body.syncImages;
    var allProducts = "" + req.body.allProducts;
 
    console.log("[SYNC] timestamp = " + timestamp);
    console.log("[SYNC] userId = " + userId);
    console.log("[SYNC] projectId = " + projectId);
    console.log("[SYNC] imageBaseURL = " + imageBaseURL);
    console.log("[SYNC] syncImages = " + syncImages);
    console.log("[SYNC] allProducts = " + allProducts);
 
     var username = {Clarastream USERNAME to operate as};
     var base64up = {base64 encoded string of "clarastream_username:password"} 

    var requestOptions = {
        host: "https://services.clarastream.com",
        port: '443',
        path: '/project/' + projectId + "?masterUserName=" + username
        method: 'GET',
        "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=utf-8",
        "Authorization": "Basic " + base64up
    };

    // Make an outgoing request to ask for products
    var post_req = 
        http.request(requestOptions, function(res) {
            console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
            console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
            res.setEncoding('utf8');
            
            res.on('data', function(chunk) {
                responseStr += chunk;i'
                console.log('Response: ' + chunk);
            });
    
            res.on('end', function() {
                callback(responseStr);
            })
    
        });

    post_req.on('error', function(err) {
             console.error('Problem with HTTP request: ' + e.message);
    });

    post_req.end();

});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Workflow Examples 

### Basic 
A general workflow for getting started with the ClaraStream API might look like this: 

+ Create a request listener endpoint in your desired language / environment (see above). 
+ Create a new connection to your listener from within ClaraStream's UI.
+ Create categories from your site in ClaraStream via the API or ClaraStream's UI.
+ Create a template using ClaraStream's API or UI 
+ Create data attributes within the template
    + This allows front end users to manipulate and map your applications product data from within
      the ClaraStream UI.
+ The ClaraStream UI user can now upload products through the UI which will map to categories and data attributes,
  and trigger a sync operation on that data. If you've set up a ClaraStream request listener, its now up to you
  to get the products from a data set (Project) and use them in your particular application - most
  likely inserting them into your product database. 


# API Resources

# Group Product

## A Product [/product/{productId}]

Allows referencing a single specific Product object with all its details. One Product is either a) associated to a particular Project or b) a **BASE** Product. A Project is a
top level 'container' that groups a set of Products. Read more about Projects below. A Base Product is the considered the master record of a particular product.

Capture the Sun, Moon, and planets like never before and create crisp, high-resolution images. Skyris cameras are the first to offer ultra-fast USB 3.0 connections combined with the most popular Sony CCD chips used for planetary imaging. Skyris also features a Celestron-designed camera body which helps dissipate heat to minimize the effect of thermal noise on the CCD.Celestron Partners with The Imaging SourceFor years, The Imaging Source has provided amateur astronomers with high-quality CCD cameras that elevate amateur planetary imaging from a casual hobby into an art form. The Imaging Source's astronomical cameras are known for high quality, value, and performance. Now, Celestron is proud to partner with The Imaging Source on the Skyris line.Skyris 618C using the Sony ICX618ALA CCD SensorSome of the world's most advanced planetary imagers choose this Sony CCD sensor. It is perfectly suited for planetary imaging due to its speed, sensitivity, pixel size, and chip size. With the 618C, you'll be able to image up to 120 frames per second. You'll gather more data in less time, and capture brief moments of stable air to create the sharpest planetary images. This small chip features ample pixel size, making it the ideal match for long focal length telescopes like the Schmidt-Cassegrain and EdgeHD. Monochrome Sensor for Maximum SensitivityThe Skyris 618M is a monochrome camera, offering you the most senstivity for capturing the best possible astroimages. Either use the camera by itself to capture stunning  black-and-white images of the Moon and planets, or attach your own filters and filter wheel to create your own color planetary images. Celestron has designed the Skyris Filter Wheel as the perfect companion to Skyris monochrome cameras.Skyris cameras do not have an optical window. This makes cleaning your camera easier and ensures maximum light transmission with no risk of internal reflections.Included Celestron iCap SoftwareAll Skyris cameras include Celestron iCap capture software and stacking software, for Windows systems only. iCap software allows you to easily control the camera, snap your images or movie file, and export them. Next, you'll bring your images or movies into the stacking software, where you can automatically filter the best images and stack them to create your masterpiece.Using Skyris as an AutoguiderEquipped with Sony EXview HAD CCD sensors, Skyris cameras make excellent autoguiders.  If used with a Celestron mount, Skyris can be connected as a DirectShow device or WDM-style webcam. Simply plug the hand controller into the supplied serial cable and use a USB to RS-232 Adapter (not included).  The camera works with popular software like MaxIm DL or freeware like PHD Guiding. Other non-Celestron mounts work with a GPUSB available from Shoestring Astronomy to use with the same software programs, instantly turning your Skyris camera into a high-end autoguider that plugs into the ST-4 autoguider port on your mount.

                        "description": "The Off-Axis Guider is an essential astroimaging accessory for long focal length telescopes that require the most accurate guiding possible. The Celestron Off-Axis Guider uses a prism to intercept a small portion of the telescopes focal plane (outside the field of view of the main imaging camera) to locate a guide star. Any movement seen by the guide star will be the exact same movement seen by the imaging camera. Guiding this way will correct for tracking errors, as well as opto-mechanical errors or flexure. The result: better astroimages with pinpoint round stars.Off-Axis Guiders have been around for a long time, but typically pose three main challenges:    Finding a guide star from the far edges of the telescopes focal plane can be difficult, considering the small field of view and sometimes less-than-ideal illumination.    Getting both imaging camera and autoguider to reach focus with one another is time consuming and sometimes requires experimentation.    Additional spacers and adapters are usually required for your particular camera, telescope, and autoguider, which adds to cost and complexity.Celestron's Off-Axis Guider addresses these challenges by:    Providing a large 12.5mm prism that can be adjusted to move closer to the center of the telescopes focal plane, depending on the size of the imaging camera. This results in brighter guide stars, with the help of the large prism to fully illuminate the autoguider sensor.    Featuring a high-quality, fixed-orientation Helical focuser. This provides extremely smooth and accurate focus of the autoguider without changing (or twisting) the autoguider camera orientation.    Including all the needed spacers and adapters are included for most common imaging configurations, including DSLR cameras, Nightscape CCD cameras, and more.

The Celestron Off-Axis Guider uses a prism to intercept a small portion of the telescopes focal plane (outside the field of view of the main imaging camera) to locate a guide star. Any movement seen by the guide star will be the exact same movement seen by the imaging camera. Guiding this way will correct for tracking errors, as well as opto-mechanical errors or flexure.

# Group Project 

**WARNING!** - Some functionality within Projects **will be deprecated**. You should primarily be using base products directly within the API. 
Moving forward products that are part of a project will be merged into a base product from within the ClaraStream UI - then be availabe for syncing. 

## A Project [/project/{projectId}]

A single Project object that contains all the information associated. A Project is typically a grouping of skus that some independenant batch processing will be performed on. 
An example would be updating base products with new information, or exporting particular products with particular information. A Project is associated with a template and a particular shopping cart or remote endpoint.

sent, not just the fields that need updating. For specific formatting requirements see *A New Template* below.

## A New Template [/template/cartId/{cartId}]
Create a new template. This holds the data point mappings between ClaraStream and your endpoint.
Every data attribute is put inside the "extraOptions" JSON object, which allows maximum flexibility to 
accept virtually any data attribute. 

Each attribute is its own object, cotaining three key/value pairs:

            // defines, if the data attribute is used within ClaraStream for syncing and editing from the UI.
            used: {true , false}
            // defines the type for type checking and formating within ClaraStream
            type: {text-entry, text-area, dropdown, multi-select, text-entry-money}
            // defines whether a data attribute is required. If an attribute is required, and project
            // sync is triggered. ClaraStream will issue a warning in the UI saying a particular sku is
            // missing some required data
            optional: {true, false}




+ Parameters
    + cartId (required, string) ... a particular endpoint or shopping cart id to associate to.

## Category Tree [/category/cartId/{cartId}/]

A category tree structure for one endpoint. Contains all categories for that endpoint with links to children, parents, and ancestors. 
For ClaraStreams purposes when referencing a specific category use the "id" field. "categoryId" is meant to be an id used at the endpoint, e.g., in this result "categoryId: 46", would be Magento's category number. 
"Root Catalog" is always the primary ancestor of every category tree. 

+ Parameters 
    + cartId (required, string) ... a particular endpoint or shopping cart id.
